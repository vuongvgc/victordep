                <h2>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h2>
                <ul class="story">
                    <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
                    <li><strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm 
                        to attend the University of Minnesota,
                         thanks to a Depression era program known
                          as the <q>National Youth Administration</q></li>
                    <li><strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school 
                        and save up more money. Works in the Civilian
                         Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans.
                         <q>I saw how food changed them</q>, he said. 
                         <q>All of this left scars on me.</q> </li>
                    <li><strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and 
                        takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>

                        Gets laid off due to budget cuts. 
                        Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, 
                        he returns to school study under Stakman,
                         who teaches him about breeding 
                         pest-resistent plants.</li>
                    <li><strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the
                        Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. 
                        Instead, the military asked his lab to 
                        work on waterproof glue, DDT to control 
                        malaria, disinfectants, and other applied
                         science.</li>
                    <li><strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D.
                    in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
                    <li>

                        leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant
                        pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000
                        different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different
                        varieties for each major climate on Earth.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each
                        season, doubling wheat yields
                    </li>  
                    <li><strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat
                        with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds
                        well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding
                        strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate
                        mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
                    <li><strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically
                        increase their maize and sorghum yields
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M
                        University
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food
                        supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way
                        we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops
                        are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying
                        plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science,
                        people were selecting the best breeds."
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
